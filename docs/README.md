- **Copy Price:** quick-copy button to use the selected gas value in alerts or Auto-Tx setup

### Recommendation
Shows the currently optimal gas to target, e.g.:

> You can likely get a transaction through at **0.39 Gwei** if you wait about 5 minutes.

Derived from short-term prediction over recent block averages.

### Savings

- **Net Saved (USD/ETH)**
- **Events:** total triggered actions
- **Best Single:** biggest saving achieved
Selectable timeframe (24h / 7d / 30d).
